3D printable resolution phantom for MRI

We have uploaded only a low-resolution .stl-file of the phantom due to space limitations. 
A suitable viewer may be found e.g. here: https://www.3d-tool.de/de-free-viewer-download.htm (windows).

We are happy to share a high-resolution version of the phantom (.stl format). If you are interested, please contact us at
