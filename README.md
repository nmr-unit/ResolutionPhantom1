3D printable resolution phantom for MRI

We have uploaded .stl-files of the phantom of moderate resolution due to space limitations. 
A suitable viewer may be found e.g. here: https://www.3d-tool.de/de-free-viewer-download.htm (windows).

If a higher-resolution version is needed, we are happy to share it as well. If you are interested, please contact us at
